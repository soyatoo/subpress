        <section class="about-yearbook">
          <h2>What is the yearbook?</h2>
          <p>A yearly collection of pictures and stories that showcase the global exploring community's creativity and insanity. It captures who was around and what we did - the parties, the daring infiltrations, the cruisy explores, and everything in between. I tend to prefer candid shots. To maximize your chances of being included, read these guidelines and ask questions if needed. Going through past Yearbooks will also give you an idea of what I like, as due to submission volume and page count, I simply can't include everyone.<br><br>

          Due to the nature of content published, the yearbook’s audience is kept on a strictly vetted basis. Please do not share submission details or the book itself unless you’ve asked first.</p>
