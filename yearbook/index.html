      <p>Deadline: <b>26th of January 2024</b></p>
      <p>Send to: <a href="mailto:subliminalpress@gmail.com">subliminalpress@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>Big files can be sent via <a href="https://wetransfer.com/">Wetransfer</a></p>
      <p>Please note that as much as we'd love to include everyone's work, we can't. The yearbook shouldn't be viewed as 
        a vessel for any individual to view their own work, rather a time captule representing the breadth of the global exploring community.</p>

      <h2 id="about">What is the yearbook?</h2>
      <p>A collection of pictures and stories that showcase the year that was. It's about seeing who was around and what we did, rather than amazing pics of people standing in tunnels (though a few of those do get in).</p>
      
      <div class="chunk"></div>

      <h2 id="photos">Photo requirements</h2>
      <p>- Taken between <strong>1st of Jan 2023 and 31st Dec 2023</strong>;</p>
      <p>- Visibly exploring related*;</p>
      <p>- People in frame*;</p>
      <p>- Faces unblurred (they'll be blurred on request but I like to make them all the same style!);</p>
      <p>- Photos you have personally taken! Or tell me who took it and I'll ask them if I can use it;</p>
      <p>- Phone / DSLR / Film photos are all fine, but plz not tiny resolution (1000px + on one side absolute minimum);</p>
      <p>- As many photos as you like, I might enjoy a pic that you're iffy on, or dislike one you love. Hedge your bets ;)</p>
      <p><i>* If you write something about the image it may be included without these.</i></p>
      <div class="chunk"></div>

      <h2 id="#stories">Story requirements</h2>
      <p>- Exploring related;</p>
      <p>- A google doc/word/notepad file so I can store it and not forget (as happens with email);</p>
      <p>- If you have pics with your story, send them in the place you think they'd best sit and we can workshop;</p>
      <p>- No names or location details if it's spicy;</p>
      <p>- No more than 2 stories per contributor.</p>   
      <div class="chunk"></div>

      <h2 id="order">Ordering</h2>
      <p>Everyone who submits will have a book put aside for them by default, but if you need to order multiple copies or aren't submitting, send an email to lodge a pre-order.</p>
