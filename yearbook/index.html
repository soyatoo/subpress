      <h2>What is the yearbook?</h2>
      <div class="midChunk"></div>

      <h5>A yearly collection of pictures and stories that showcase the global exploring community's creativity and insanity. 
        It captures who was around and what we did - the parties, the daring infiltrations, the cruisy explores, and everything inbetween. 
        I tend to preference candid shots. To maximise your chances of being included, read these guidelines and ask questions if need be. Going through past Yearbooks will also 
        give you an idea of what I like, as due to submission volume and page-count I simply can't include everyone.<br><br>

      Due to the nature of content published, the yearbook’s audience is kept on a strictly vetted basis. 
      Please do not share submission details or the book itself unless you’ve asked first.</h5>
