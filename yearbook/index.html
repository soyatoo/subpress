      <h5>Please note that as much as I'd love to include everyone, due to the volume of submissions I simply can't. The yearbook shouldn't be viewed as 
        a vessel for any individual to view their work, rather a time capsule of the entire community. To maximise your chances of being included, 
        make sure you read these guidelines and ask questions if need be.</h5>

      <h2>What is the yearbook?</h2>
      <div class="smallChunk"></div>

      <h5>A yearly collection of pictures and stories that showcase the global exploring community's creativity and insanity. It captures who was around and what we did - the parties, the daring infiltrations, the cruisy explores, and everything inbetween - rather than amazing pics 
      of people standing in tunnels (though a few of those do get in). Continue reading the guidelines to know what you should submit.</h5>

      <h2>Photo requirements</h2>
      <div class="smallChunk"></div>

      <h5><color="red">*</color> If you write something about the image it may be included without these.</h5>
      <p>- Taken between <strong>1st of Jan 2023 and 31st Dec 2023</strong>;</p>
      <p>- Visibly exploring related*;</p>
      <p>- People in frame*;</p>
      <p>- Faces unblurred (they'll be blurred on request but I like to make them all the same style!);</p>
      <p>- Photos you have personally taken! Or tell me who took it and I'll ask them if I can use it;</p>
      <p>- Phone / DSLR / Film photos are all fine, but plz not tiny resolution (1000px + on one side absolute minimum);</p>
      <p>- As many photos as you like, I might enjoy a pic that you're iffy on, or dislike one you love. Hedge your bets.</p>
      <p><i>* If you write something about the image it may be included without these.</i></p>

      <p>- A google doc/word/notepad file so I can store it and not forget (as happens with email);</p>
      <p>- If you have pics with your story, send them in the place you think they'd best sit and we can workshop;</p>
      <p>- No names or location details if it's spicy;</p>
